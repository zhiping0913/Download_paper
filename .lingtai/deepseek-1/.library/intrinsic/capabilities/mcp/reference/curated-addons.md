# Curated addons — imap / telegram / feishu / wechat

LingTai's first-party email and chat integrations. Each ships as an installed Python package (`lingtai-imap`, `lingtai-telegram`, `lingtai-feishu`, `lingtai-wechat`) with its own README documenting config schema, env vars, and credentials.

## The four-step setup

1. **Read the addon's README first.** The script lives at `.library/intrinsic/capabilities/mcp/scripts/find_readme.py` and must be run with the runtime venv's Python (system `python3` may not see the addon's editable install):

   ```bash
   ~/.lingtai-tui/runtime/venv/bin/python3 \
     .library/intrinsic/capabilities/mcp/scripts/find_readme.py <pkg-name>
   ```

   `<pkg-name>` is `lingtai-imap`, `lingtai-telegram`, `lingtai-feishu`, or `lingtai-wechat`. Field names like `email_password` (imap), `bot_token` (telegram), `app_id`/`app_secret` (feishu), gewechat host (wechat) are documented there. Skipping this step is the #1 cause of "MCP boot failed" rabbit holes.

2. **Add the addon to `init.json`.** Append the registry name to the top-level `addons:` list, then add an `mcp.<name>` activation entry with the subprocess spec from the README:

   ```json
   {
     "addons": ["imap"],
     "mcp": {
       "imap": {
         "type": "stdio",
         "command": "/Users/<you>/.lingtai-tui/runtime/venv/bin/python",
         "args": ["-m", "lingtai_imap"],
         "env": {
           "LINGTAI_IMAP_CONFIG": ".secrets/imap.json"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Create the config file** at the path referenced by the env var (e.g. `.secrets/imap.json`). Use the schema from the README — copy it verbatim, don't paraphrase.

4. **Run `system(action="refresh")`.** The `mcp` capability decompresses the catalog record into `mcp_registry.jsonl`, the loader spawns the subprocess, and the omnibus tool (`imap`, `telegram`, etc.) appears in your tool surface.

## Distribution names

| Registry name | Distribution name  | Module name        |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| `imap`        | `lingtai-imap`     | `lingtai_imap`     |
| `telegram`    | `lingtai-telegram` | `lingtai_telegram` |
| `feishu`      | `lingtai-feishu`   | `lingtai_feishu`   |
| `wechat`      | `lingtai-wechat`   | `lingtai_wechat`   |

Pass `<distribution name>` to `find_readme.py`. Pass `<module name>` to `find_readme.py --module`.

## After it's running

Inbound events (new emails, chat messages) flow into your `.mcp_inbox/<name>/` via the LICC v1 inbox callback contract — the kernel auto-injects them into your next turn as `[system]` messages. You don't poll; the kernel does. Outbound calls go through the omnibus tool: `imap(action="send", ...)`, `telegram(action="send_message", ...)`, etc. — see each addon's README for the action list.

## WeChat setup checklist

WeChat has unique pitfalls that catch agents off-guard. Walk this checklist on every new WeChat setup to avoid wasting the human's time:

1. **Install into LingTai's runtime venv** — the `lingtai-wechat-bootstrap` script lives inside the venv, not on the system PATH:
   ```bash
   ~/.lingtai-tui/runtime/venv/bin/pip install git+https://github.com/Lingtai-AI/lingtai-wechat.git
   ```

2. **Run bootstrap with the full venv path** from the project root:
   ```bash
   ~/.lingtai-tui/runtime/venv/bin/lingtai-wechat-bootstrap .secrets/wechat
   ```

3. **No manual credential copy needed** — the MCP resolves `LINGTAI_WECHAT_CONFIG` relative to the project root (the parent of `.lingtai/`), so `.secrets/wechat/config.json` works from both bootstrap and the MCP. Credentials are written next to `config.json`.

4. **WSL users**: bootstrap auto-detects WSL and uses `cmd.exe /c start` or `wslview` to open the browser. If neither works, it prints the HTML file path for manual opening.

5. **Refresh the MCP** after bootstrap writes credentials:
   ```
   system(action="refresh")
   ```

6. **Test the connection**:
   ```
   wechat(action="check")
   ```

7. **Session expiry** — WeChat sessions expire (~30 days). When expired, a LICC event with `metadata.event_type: "session_expired"` arrives. Re-run the bootstrap to re-authenticate.
